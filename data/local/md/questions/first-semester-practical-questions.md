1. **Write a program to input a natural number less than 1000 and display it in words. Test your program on the sample data and some random data.**
   
   <u>Sample input and output of the program</u>

   Input: 29

   Output: TWENTY NINE

   Input: 17001

   Output: OUT OF RANGE

   Input: 119

   Output: ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN

   Input: 500

   Output: FIVE HUNDRED

2. Encryption is a technique of encoding messages to maintain their secrecy. A String array of size 'n' where 'n' is greater than 1 and less than 10, stores single sentences (each sentence ends with a full stop) in each row of the array.

    **Write a program to accept the size of the array. Display an appropriate message if the size is not satisfying the given condition. Define a string array of the inputted size and fill it with sentences row-wise. Change the sentence of the odd rows with an encryption of two character ahead of the original character. Also change the sentence of the even rows by storing the sentence in reverse order. Display the encrypted sentences as per the sample data given below.**

    <u>Test your program on the sample data and some random data</u>

    Input: n=4

    IT IS CLOUDY.

    IT MAY RAIN.

    THE WEATHER IS FINE.

    IT IS COOL.

    Output:

    KV KU ENQWFA.

    RAIN MAY IT.

    VJG YGCVJGT KU HKPG.

    COOL IS IT.

    Input: n=13

    Output: INVALID ENTRY

3. **Design a program which accepts your date of birth in dd mm yyyy format. Check whether the date entered is valid or not. If it is valid, display "VALID DATE", also compute and display the day number of the year for the date of birth. If it is invalid, display "INVALID DATE" and then terminate the program.**
   
   <u>Testing of the program</u>

   06

   2010

   Output: INVALID DATE
