            <p class = "sample-questions">1. Write a program to accept a number and check whether the number is an Angstrom number or not.</p>
            <p class = "secondary-text">(Angstrom number is a number that equals the sum of its digits, each raised to a power of number of digits. For example, if you have a number like 153, it's an Armstrong number because 1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> equals 153.)</p>
            <p class = "sample-questions">2. Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer (n). Create an arrays with 'n' elements. Ask the user to enter the 'n' double value to populate the array. Create another array which stores the square root of the number. Display both the arrays.</p>
            <p class = "sample-questions">3. Write a program to input a sentence and find the number of words which begin and end with a vowel; also print those words.</p>
            <p class = "sample-questions">4. Encryption is a technique of coding messages to maintain their secrecy. A String array of size 'n' where 'n' is greater than 1 and less than 10, stores single sentences (each sentence ends with a full stop) in each row of the array.<br><b>Write a program to accept the size of the array. Display an appropriate message if the size is not satisfying the given condition. Define a string array of the inputted size and fill it with sentences row-wise. Change the sentence of the odd rows with an encryption of two character ahead of the original character. Also change the sentence of the even rows by storing the sentence in reverse order. Display the encrypted sentences.</b></p>
            <p class = "secondary-text">Input: n = 4<br>IT IS CLOUDY.<br>IT MAY RAIN.<br>THE WEATHER IS FINE.<br>IT IS COOL.<br>Output:<br>KV KU ENQWFA.<br>RAIN MAY IT.<br>VJG YGCVJGT KU HKPG.<br>COOL IS IT.<br>Input: n = 13 <br>Output: INVALID ENTRY</p>
            <p class = "sample-questions">5. A number M will be a <b>monocot number</b> if the sum of its extreme (first and last) digits is equal to the sum of mean (all digits except first and last) digits. If the sum of extreme digits is not equal to the sum of mean digits, the number is called <b>dicot number</b>.</p>
            <p class = "secondary-text"><b>Example 1</b><br>INPUT: N: 34326<br>OUTPUT: Sum of mean digits = 9<br>Sum of extreme digits = 9<br>34326 is a monocot number<br><b>Example 2:</b><br>INPUT: N = 173156<br>OUTPUT: Sum of mean digits = 16<br>Sum of extreme digits = 7<br>173156 is a dicot number.</p>
